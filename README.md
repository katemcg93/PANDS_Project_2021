# PANDS Project 2021
Repository for Fisher's Iris Data Set Analysis

Rough summary of what I'm going to talk about in this file

Introduction: name of project, my name, code and modules required to run programme. V. high level introduction (about 1 line) on what the project is

Summary of dataset: History of dataset, data on three different species of iris flower, collected in 1936, measuring 4 variables, sepal and petal width/length. Talk about how it's used as intro to data analysis/machine learning and why.

Research questions: When I started this project I was aiming to answer three key questions: 1. What are the characteristics of the dataset as a whole, and on a species level? i.e. what is the degree of distribution within the dataset with respect to each of the variables, is the data normally distributed as a whole, on a species level, mean and standard deviation, heavy tailed or light tailed etc.  2. Do the 4 numerical variables influence each other? for example, if petal width increases, does this make an increas in petal width more likely? 3. Is there a significant inter-species difference in the mean value for each of the numercial variables?

Code: Include snippets, explain what code does, screenshots, observations
