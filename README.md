## Introduction

This repository contains code to characterise and analyse the Iris Flower Data set, and output a summary text file and graphs highlighting key findings.
## Code and Modules/Libraries
The code associated with this project is written exclusively in Python, and was developed using the following software:</br>
  * Anaconda
  * Visual Studio Code
  * Cmder

The following libararies should be installed in order to run the code without issue:
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib (pyplot)
  * Seaborn
  * Scipy (stats)

Additionally, the following standard python modules are leveraged in the code:
  * Csv (to read in and manipulate the Iris Data Set)
  * Os  (for file creation exception handling)
 </br>

## Overview of Data Set

The Iris Data Set was first published in 1936, in a paper entitled “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”, which is recognized as a seminal work within the domain of pattern recognition literature [1]. The paper proposes a linear model to differentiate members of three species of iris plant, based on the shape Its author, Sir Ronald Fisher, was a celebrated statistician and geneticist. Other notable contributions made by Fisher to the field of statistics include the Fisher's Exact Test, which determines whether a non-random association exists between two categorical (grouping) variables and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, which is a method of determining whether the means of two or more groups differ significantly [2].

The Iris Data Set consists of 50 samples from three species of Iris Flowe
